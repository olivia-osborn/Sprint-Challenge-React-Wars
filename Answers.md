1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a library that developers use that make it easier to scale large web apps that require lots of user data. React JS allows us to break down an app into reusable components that makes scaling the website much more manageable. React also gives us the ability to deal with constant incoming data from users using "state" and "props" which can be passed down to components in a reusable or "reactive" way. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in react means looking at a website and breaking it down into a hierarchy of components. Having these separate components allows us to reuse code instead of coding multiple components that look the same. Thinking in react also means knowing which component the state (or data) should be stored in and where it should be passed down to (as props).
